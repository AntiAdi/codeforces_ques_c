Hello and welcome to my Codeforces solutions for questions in C language.

1. I have classified problems into categories based on their ratings in the problem section, And have added the codeforces links to the problem statements as a comment in each problem.c file. 

2. I also leave lots of comments while writing code, So everything is fully packed into the source code itself.

3. The solutions are check by myself taking all possible input domains and their corrosponding required outputs, So they are essentially 100% correct as per the problem statement is concerned. However any suggestions on scope of improvements are always welcomed.
